            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Dream X was born from a simple observation: social media has incredible power to connect 
                people, but it often pulls us away from the things that truly matter. We asked ourselves, 
                "What if there was a platform that helped people grow instead of just scroll?"
            </p>
            <p>
                That's when Dream X was created — a social network specifically designed for productive 
                people who want to share their passions, build meaningful skills, and inspire others along 
                the way.

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that the best social platforms should amplify your potential, not drain your time. 
                Dream X is built on three core principles:
            </p>
            <ul class="philosophy-list">
                <li><strong>Growth over Distraction:</strong> Every feature is designed to help you learn, 
                    create, and improve.</li>
                <li><strong>Community over Competition:</strong> Connect with like-minded individuals who 
                    celebrate your progress and support your journey.</li>
                <li><strong>Authenticity over Perfection:</strong> Share real progress, honest struggles, 
                    and genuine achievements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>The Dream X Difference</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional social media that uses algorithms to keep you scrolling, Dream X uses a 
                <strong>Reverse Algorithm</strong> that starts with your ultra-specific interests and gradually 
                broadens your horizons. This means you'll discover new passions while staying connected to what 
                you already love.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're learning an instrument, mastering a programming language, improving your fitness, 
                or exploring any productive hobby — Dream X is your platform to shine.

            <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
            <p>
                We're building more than just an app — we're building a movement of people who choose growth 
                over stagnation, progress over perfection, and community over isolation.
